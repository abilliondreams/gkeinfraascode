# GKE infrastructuee as code jenkins template to Deploy GKE Service Cluster, Mongodb, istio gateway.

This example illustrates how to deploy a service to the created cluster using the kubernetes provider.

It will:
- Create a cluster
- Configure authentication for the Kubernetes provider
- Create an Nginx Pod
- Create an Nginx Service
- Create an Mongodb backend
- Create istiod and istio ingress gateway
